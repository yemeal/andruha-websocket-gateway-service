# Andruha WebSocket Gateway Service

## Purpose and current status

This repository is the skeleton for the Andruha Messenger WebSocket Gateway Service. It contains package boundaries and operational HTTP infrastructure only. No messenger business behavior is implemented.

## Responsibility and explicit non-responsibilities

Own realtime connections, connection routing, and online delivery in future iterations.

It does not own durable messages or read state, credentials, public profiles, media objects, or a separate Notification Service domain.

## Hexagonal/DDD layer map

- `domain`: framework-free future business model.
- `application`: future use cases and owned ports; depends only on domain.
- `infrastructure`: future adapters implementing application ports.
- `entrypoints`: transport translation that will call application services.
- `core`: configuration and cross-cutting logging only.

The dependency direction is `entrypoints -> application -> domain` and `infrastructure -> application ports -> domain`.

## Entrypoints

- `app.entrypoints.http.main:create_app` - FastAPI factory
- `GET /health/live` - process liveness
- `GET /health/ready` - initialized application readiness
- `app.entrypoints.websocket` - empty future WebSocket transport boundary
- `app.entrypoints.messaging` - empty future messaging transport boundary

No business API or transport contract is available yet.

## Configuration variables

- `SERVICE_NAME`, `APP_VERSION`, `APP_ENVIRONMENT`
- `HOST`, `PORT`
- `DEV_LOGS`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `MUTE_LOGGERS`

## Liveness and readiness

`GET /health/live` reports that the process is running. `GET /health/ready` reports readiness after application lifespan initialization. It intentionally performs no fake dependency probes.

## Local build and run status

The multi-stage image definition and factory-form Uvicorn command are present. Dependency bootstrap is deferred: runtime dependencies and a lock file are intentionally absent, so application image startup is not supported in this stage.
